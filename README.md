# They are coming for you

Launching your first rocket exploits your location. Enemies come crashing down from the skies to infiltrate your base. One solid wall around your factory was sufficient to keep the locals out, but that will no longer work for our new friends.

# This mod is for you

-   If you like new challenging enemies
-   If you like to play with fresh mods which are still under development

# This mod is not for you

-   If you do not launch any rockets (though you can use `/invade` to manually start the invasions)
-   If you don't like to play with enemies

# Known issues

This mod is in early development stage, yet functional and quite bug free. Known areas of improvement:

-   Enemies spawned inside a collision box might get stuck
-   Consecutive crashing rockets may destroy earlier crashed rockets
-   Crashed rockets might not be destructible
-   Entry angle of the rocket is slightly off
-   Enemies need to be balanced
